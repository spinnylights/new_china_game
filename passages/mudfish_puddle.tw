::Mudfish Puddle
The puddle is almost a small pond. There are little grassy plants growing out of it. The water is a completely opaque brown color, so you can't make out how deep it is.

To your left is a gigantic pile of snack foods. To your right are half a teddy bear and a couple of earthworms.
<<if ($mudfishLove is true) and not ($mudfishDead is true)>>
You open a bag of <strong><<getSnackFood>></strong> and toss them to the mudfish. The mudfish gobbles them up hungrily.

[[walk away from the puddle|Basketball Court]]
<<else if not ($mudfishDead is true)>>
You hear some splashing at your feet. You look down and see that a mudfish has crawled halfway out of the pond to greet you. It looks thin and pitiful.

You could [[feed the mudfish some snack food|Mudfish Puddle][$mudfishLove = true]] from the pile. You could also [[abandon the mudfish|Basketball Court]].
<<else>>
A <strong>mudfish</strong> once lived here. (;ï¸µ;)

The rest of the [[basketball court|Basketball Court]] is behind you. You could also just go back out onto the [[streets|City Streets]].
