You're sitting on the edge of a small, dirty bed in a dusty Airstream trailer.

You've just finished your breakfast of a box of mac 'n' cheese you found in the cupboard above the sink. You cooked it in a pan over a fire outside.

It's excitingâ€”you're on the outskirts of a small city. After being in the countryside for weeks, the idea of being in a city is full of promise.
