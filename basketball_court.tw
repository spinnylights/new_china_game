You're standing in an empty basketball court. The court surface has become grey-green with time. Bits of pamphlets and a few pills rustle around your feet in the breeze.

You notice a [[big puddle|Mudfish Puddle]] at the far end of the court.

The [[city streets|City Streets]] are back the way you came.
